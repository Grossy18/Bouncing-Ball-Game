# Bouncing-Ball-Game
The **Bouncing Ball Game** is built with Raylib in C. Players control a paddle to keep the ball in play as it bounces off the paddle, walls, and a red line. With three chances, the game ends when all are lost. It includes a start screen, game over message, and chance tracking, showcasing simple game mechanics and collision detection.
